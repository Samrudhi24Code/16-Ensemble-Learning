# Problem Statement:
# The dataset aims to predict whether a movie will win a 'Start Tech Oscar' based on its features.
# The objective is to classify movies into two categories (Oscar or not) based on movie attributes like availability of 3D, Genre, etc.
# This model will help studios or distributors understand which movie features might increase the chances of receiving an Oscar.

# Business Objective:
# The goal is to maximize classification accuracy, assisting movie studios or distributors in understanding 
# which attributes contribute to a movieâ€™s chances of winning a "Start Tech Oscar."

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv(r"E:\Data Science\15-Random Forest\movies_classification.csv")

# Display information about the DataFrame
df.info()

# Comment on DataFrame columns
# The '3D_available' and 'Genre' columns are categorical (object type) and need to be converted into numerical features.
# This can be done using one-hot encoding (dummy variables).

df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=["3D_available", "Genre"], drop_first=True)

# Assigning input (predictors) and output (target) variables
# The predictors are all columns except 'Start_Tech_Oscar'
predictors = df.loc[:, df.columns != "Start_Tech_Oscar"]
target = df["Start_Tech_Oscar"]

# Using a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.

# Creating a RandomForestClassifier model
rand_for = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, n_jobs=-1, random_state=42)

# Explanation of hyperparameters:
# n_estimators=500: Increases model accuracy by creating more decision trees. A higher number of trees helps the model generalize better, especially with large datasets.
# n_jobs=-1: Uses all available CPU cores to speed up the training process, crucial when we have a large number of trees.
# random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility of the results, so that the model generates the same output each time it is run.

'''
Summary:
- This Random Forest model is used to predict whether a movie will win a 'Start Tech Oscar' based on various features like genre and 3D availability.
- The business goal is to identify which attributes improve a movie's chances of winning an award, providing valuable insights for movie studios and distributors.
- The model's performance is evaluated using both accuracy scores and confusion matrices, both on training and test datasets.
